            <article>
                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    The file <strong>index.html</strong>, as it relates to websites and servers, 
                    is the name of the resource generally served when a user requests the root
                    path of a website. In most cases--the Apache server at access.engr.oregonstate.edu among them--
                     the root directory ("/") is mapped to index.html. Another name for index.html is the "designated homepage,"
                    served to clients when a GET request is made to the root path of website in question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As <strong>HTTP requests</strong> are how clients and servers communicate across the web,
                    the ability to inspect this network traffic is a vital part of a web developer's toolkit. 
                    Its functionality is available in most modern browsers; in Chrome, it can be found
                    by pressing Function+F12 (to open DevTools), and then clicking Network. This opens
                    the Network tab, where network traffic--information being sent between the client
                    and the <strong>server</strong>--can be inspected. This communication between the client and the server is 
                    composed of a status (common HTTP status codes include: 200 (success!), 400, 403, and 404), 
                    a request header (containing the <strong>URL</strong>, request method, <strong>HTTP status code</strong>, IP address, and
                    policy), a response header (containing cache details, date, content type, the date), and
                    the body (the information requested from the <strong>server</strong>). When a file is stored locally, and being sent to
                    the server in a <strong>POST or PUT request</strong>, the file's details can be viewed in the Network Tab's 
                    "Payload" subcategory. However, when the information is being sent from the (remote) server to 
                    the (local) client as a part of a <strong>GET request</strong>, the file's details can be viewed in the 
                    Network Tab's "Response" subcategory.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When viewed in the Network tab, favicon.ico file has a status 200; this indicates to the user that the browser has
                    issued a GET request for this resource, and the resource has been returned successfully.
                    However, main.css and main.js files do not display 200 on the Network tab (at present, they display nothing). 
                    There is no data on the Network tab for these resources because they have not yet been created. The only network traffic to be seen 
                     is two successful GET requests for favicon.ico and index.html.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that the <strong>URL</strong> to this file contains four parts:
                    the scheme, the host domain, the subdomain, and the resource(s). <strong>The scheme</strong>
                    is the protocol the client must use to access this resource (the protocol for all files on
                    web.engr.oregonstate.edu are secure HyperText Transfer Protocol). The <strong>host domain</strong>
                    for this site is oregonstate.edu. The <strong>subdomain</strong> is "web.engr." and
                    the resources are index.html and favicon.ico.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>"Frontend design"</strong> is a combination of the UI (user interface) and the UX (user experience)--in short,
                    how the site looks and feels from a user's perspective. While the UI is focused on the visual design
                    of the site and the UX is more concerned with usability (how well the user can achieve their goals),
                    both form and function are necessary to create a site that users will return to. To ensure a website
                    is usable, keep these principles in mind: <strong>The 5 "E's" of Usability</strong>. Is a website...

                <p>
                    Coming to the aid of the frontend developer, looking to make a more 
                    structured, organized, and easily-navigable website, are <strong>page layout tags</strong>.
                    While they can function similarly to divs, as containers for different 
                    components and content areas, page layout tags are different from divs in a crucial way;
                    they allow screen readers and search engines to better understand the structure
                    and purpose of the various areas of a website. These tags include: <strong>header</strong> (containing items
                    such as a title, publisher, and slogan--similar to a newspaper masthead),
                    <strong>nav</strong> (a block of links, allowing the user to external sites, other pages of the current site, or content further down the page), 
                    <strong>main</strong> (the site's primary content), <strong>section</strong> (a group of content
                        with a similar purpose or theme), <strong>article</strong> (a single, specific topic), 
                    <strong>aside</strong> (content related to an article), 
                    and <strong>footer</strong> (appears below the main tag, can contain copyright, contact information,
                        and (frequently) links to lesser-used pages).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these page layout tags provide structure to a single page of a website,
                    <strong>tools within the nav bar--anchors</strong>--create hyperlinks which connect a 
                        website to external content, internal content, and from page to page.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>External content: connects a website to content outside the current site. The 
                        href="" inside of external content anchor links to external sites, such as href="oregonstate.edu"
                    </li>
                    <li>Internal content: connects a user to content on the current page. The
                        href="" inside of internal content anchors will contain #ids of individual elements on the DOM tree,
                        such as href="#travelGallery"
                    </li>
                    <li>From page to page: connects a user to other pages of the same website. The href="" inside 
                        these links can contain either absolute or relative paths. An example of a relative path 
                        to a website within the current directory is href="./photos.html"
                    </li>
                  </ol>
